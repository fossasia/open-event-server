## Dependencies required to run Orga Server

* Python 3

* Installation of 'Homebrew' would catalyze the process of installation
```sh
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
brew update
brew doctor
export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
```

* Postgres
```sh
brew update
brew install postgres
```
* NodeJS
```sh
brew install node
```

## Steps

Make sure you have the dependencies mentioned above installed before proceeding further.

Run the commands mentioned below with the terminal active in the project's root directory.

You may encounter problems installing 'libevent' while installing the Python packages,

run the below commands would prevent the 'egg_info' error.

```sh
brew install python3 libevent
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/ez_setup.py -o - | python3
pip install gevent gunicorn
```

* **Step 1** - Install Poetry and Python 3 requirements.

```sh
# Install Poetry
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python -
source ~/.profile

# Go to project folder and install Python dependencies
poetry install

# Activate project's virtual environment
poetry shell
```


* **Step 2** - Create the database. For that we first open the psql shell.

```sh
psql
```

* When inside psql, create a user for open-event and then using the user create the database.

```sql
create user open_event_user with password 'test';
create database test with owner=open_event_user;
```

* Once database is created, exit the psql shell with `\q` followed by ENTER.


* **Step 3** - Create application environment variables.

```sh
export DATABASE_URL=postgresql://open_event_user:start@127.0.0.1:5432/test
```


* **Step 4** - Start the postgres service on the application manually.


* **Step 5** - Create the tables. For that we will use `flask create_db`.

```sh
flask create_db
# enter email and password
flask db stamp head
```


* **Step 6** - Start the application along with the needed services.
The `&` at the end of the commands below make them run in background so that they don't hold the terminal.

```sh
# download and run redis
wget http://download.redis.io/releases/redis-3.2.1.tar.gz
tar xzf redis-3.2.1.tar.gz
rm redis-3.2.1.tar.gz
cd redis-3.2.1
make

# To run redis
redis-3.2.1/src/redis-server &

# run worker
export INTEGRATE_SOCKETIO=false
# socketio has problems with celery "blocking" tasks
# also socketio is not used in a celery task so no problem to turn it off
celery -A app.instance.celery worker -B -l INFO -c 2 &
unset INTEGRATE_SOCKETIO

# run app
flask run
```

* **Step 8** - Rejoice. Go to `localhost:5000` in your web browser to see the application live.
