# Roles

The system has two kind of role types: System Roles and Event Roles.

1. System roles are related to the Open Event organization and operators of the application.

## Using Permissions system

After running `flask create_db` Event-specific-Roles, Services and Permissions are created.

### Event Specific Roles

```
organizer
coorganizer
track_organizer
moderator
speaker
```

The Organizer is the creator of the event and can access anything related to the event (Track, Session, Speaker, Sponsor, Microlocation).

Co-organizer, just like Organizer can access anything but cannot manage user roles.

Track Organizer can only Update and Read Tracks for that event.

Moderator can only Read Tracks before they are published but cannot edit them.

Speaker can read his own sessions (even unpublished), and can edit his own information.

### Site Specific Roles (Staff)

```
admin
super_admin
```

They have access to all the resources. There can be multiple Admins but just one Super Admin. Only the Super Admin can assign users as Admins.

You can check if a user is an Admin or Super Admin using:

```python
user.is_admin
user.is_super_admin
```

You can directly check if a user comes under Staff (Admin or Super Admin):

```python
user.is_staff
```


### Services

Services come under an event. We define the following as services:

```
track
session
speaker
sponsor
microlocation
```

To check if a user is a speaker in a session use:

```python
user.is_speaker_at_session(session_id)
```


## Example code

```
>>> from app.models.permission import Permission
>>> for p in Permission.query.all():
...  create = 'Create' if p.can_create else ''
...  read = 'Read' if p.can_read else ''
...  update = 'Update' if p.can_update else ''
...  delete = 'Delete' if p.can_delete else ''
...  print p.role, p.service, create, read, update, delete
...
<Role u'organizer'> <Service u'track'> Create Read Update Delete
<Role u'organizer'> <Service u'session'> Create Read Update Delete
<Role u'organizer'> <Service u'speaker'> Create Read Update Delete
<Role u'organizer'> <Service u'sponsor'> Create Read Update Delete
<Role u'organizer'> <Service u'microlocation'> Create Read Update Delete
#
<Role u'coorganizer'> <Service u'track'>  Read Update
<Role u'coorganizer'> <Service u'session'>  Read Update
<Role u'coorganizer'> <Service u'speaker'>  Read Update
<Role u'coorganizer'> <Service u'sponsor'>  Read Update
<Role u'coorganizer'> <Service u'microlocation'>  Read Update
#
<Role u'track_organizer'> <Service u'track'>  Read Update
#
<Role u'moderator'> <Service u'track'>  Read
```

The permissions printed above adhere to https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-server/issues/623

`User` class has the following methods to check its role:

```python
user.is_organizer(event_id)
user.is_coorganizer(event_id)
user.is_track_organizer(event_id)
user.is_moderator(event_id)
```


`User` class has the following methods to check permissions:

```python
user.can_create(service, event_id)
user.can_read(service, event_id)
user.can_update(service, event_id)
user.can_delete(service, event_id)
```

e.g.
```
>>> from app.models.user import User
>>> from app.models.track import Track
>>> u = User.query.all()[0]
>>> u.can_create(Track, event_id=1)
True
>>> u.can_update(Track, event_id=1)
True
>>> u.can_update(Track, event_id=2)
False
```

You can define a user's role for an event in `UsersEventsRoles`.


Here's an example showing how a user is assigned as a Track Organizer for an Event (with `event_id = 1`).

```
>>> from app.models.users_events_roles import UsersEventsRoles as UER
>>> from app.models.user import User
>>> from app.models.event import Event
>>> from app.models.role import Role
>>> r = Role.query.filter_by(name='track_organizer').first()
>>> e = Event.query.get(1)
>>> from app.helpers.data import save_to_db
>>> u = User(email='asd@email.com')
>>> save_to_db(u, 'asfd')
True
>>> uer = UER(user=u, event=e, role=r)
>>> save_to_db(uer, 'asdf')
True
>>> from app.models.session import Session
>>> from app.models.track import Track
# 'u' is a track organizer and can only update and read tracks for an event.
>>> u.can_create(Track, 1)
False
>>> u.can_read(Track, 1)
True
>>> u.can_update(Track, 1)
True
>>> u.can_delete(Track, 1)
False
```
