###### Liability for content
The content of our website was created with the greatest of care. However, we cannot guarantee that this content is correct, complete or up to date. Pursuant to §7 par. 1 of TMG (German Telemedia Act), we, as service provider, are responsible under the general laws for our own content on this website. However, according to §§ 8 to 10 of TMG, we, as service provider, are not obligated to monitor any third-party information transmitted or stored on our website or to investigate circumstances indicating an illegal activity. This does not affect the obligations under the general laws to remove or block the use of information. However, liability in this respect is only possible from the time we become aware of an actual infringement of law. Once we become aware of such legal violations, we shall remove the respective contents immediately.

###### Liability for links
Our service includes links to external websites but we have no influence over their content. Therefore, we cannot accept responsibility for these third-party contents. In each case, it is the respective provider or operator of the linked websites who is responsible for their contents. The linked websites were checked for any legal irregularities at the time the link was established and no illegal contents were recognisable at that point in time. However, continuous monitoring of the contents of the linked pages cannot be reasonably expected unless there are concrete reasons for suspecting legal violations. Once we are aware of illegal content, we shall remove the respective links immediately.
